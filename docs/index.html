        <h1> Unequal Distribution of Economic Activities in Dayton Ohio.</h1>
        <p>Since the 1950s, cities in North America have been experiencing a new phase in urbanization dynamics. It is a form of reverse urbanization that has been termed urban shrinkage. The shrinking city phenomenon is believed to be a multidimensional process that affects the city and its suburbs. This phenomenon is characterized by population decline, economic recession, financial deficits, increasing unemployment rates, vacant housing units, and idled public facilities in the city center.</p>
        <ol>
            <br><li><i><b>Map Purpose</b></i><br/>Over the years, some cities in the United States have recorded a huge decline in population which has been attributed to the loss of economic activities. An example of this declining city is Dayton which has lost a huge population since the “great depression” however, despite the various revitalization policies that have been adopted by the municipal government, some areas in Dayton have remain unchanged. This map will look at some of the likely causes of this unequal redevelopment. Specifically, looking at the unequal distribution of economic activities in Dayton and determine if this is a factor responsible for the underdevelopment in the southern side of Dayton. I intend to use this to explain why some of the policies of the government have failed in attracting immigrants. I believe shedding light on the unequal economic activities could serve as a steppingstone in the revitalization process of these areas.</li>
            <br><li><i><b>Structure of the Map</b></i><br/>This map will focus on the Northern and Southern parts of Dayton. The interactive map will examine not just the socio-economic characteristics of the people living there but also compare the number of abandoned buildings and economic in both areas which can be presented with a choropleth map. I intend allowing users to visualize the number of business in these areas and compare with other variables like the population, income, educational level of people living around these business districts. It will also include physical features like road to determine if accessibility is one of the reasons why some areas have remained unchanged. I intend to have text in my map to show the purpose of the map likewise my result and conclusion. Being my first draft, it is likely that this structure might change a little bit sometimes later. </li>
            <br><li><i><b>Data Sources</b></i><br/>I will be using data from various agencies for this project. Population data will be accessed from the United States Census Bureau while population density can easily be derived by dividing the population by the land area of the same geographic location in sq.miles. education level, income data, and ethnicity can also be gotten from the United States Census Bureau. Business addresses might be a little bit difficult to obtain but I believe either the planning commission or business registration agency will have this.   </li>
            <br><li><i><b>Methodology</b></i><br/>To create this interactive map, I will be using the ArcGIS pro as well as the ArcGIS online to create and publish choropleth maps which will address the purpose of this project. Also, I will be using this same software to geocode the business addresses to a geographical location on the map. I might also use excel to clean my data before importing them into ArcGIS and most likely a join might be required to combine tables. I intend to use ArcGIS online to create pop-ups that will show the name and location of businesses before publishing online. </li>
